# Yudhishthira - A "Coinless" Blockchain

Why the name 'Yudhishthira'? Because blockchain never lies. ;)

This project was done as a part of Minor Project of 6th Semester, Bachelor in Computer Engineering (BCT), Puchowk Campus, Nepal. Final report for the project is available [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1JdzvoINf7c_0zuG_9UG_3ReyifUet7hu/view?usp=sharing).
