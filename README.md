# Yudhishthira - A Blockchain Based BackEnd

Why the name 'Yudhishthira'? Because blockchain never lies. ;)

## Is this project complete?

No, this is a work in progress.

## Contribution Guidelines

- The `main` branch is protected and can only be changed using PRs.
- Fork the repository, create your own branch, make the changes and make a PR. All PRs to the `main` branch will only be accepted upon review.
- Squash the commits before merging them into the main branch.
- Run `go mod tidy` before committing your changes if you are using dependencies not required for the final build (eg, profilers, timers).
- To run the executable, use the command `go build` and then run the executable `./yudhishthira`.
